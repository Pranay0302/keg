### KEG implementation by rwxrob

Learning about KEG, the knowledge exchange graph. It basically consists of Text Node, Data Node and Figure Node. KEG is simple and very much effective when it comes to storing the data using the zettlekasten method on Github. Each knowledge node has it's own features which can help to boost the amount of knowledge we consume or generate. This is a method of knowledge management which shares my learnings.
